# 🧱 Horizontal Blocks Plugin

Bring Notion-style layouts with blocks side-by-side, resizable markdown blocks that support full Obsidian syntax including images, embeds, and internal links.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔲 **Side-by-side markdown blocks** using `horizontal` code block
- 📏 **Resizable columns** with a draggable divider
- 🧠 **Dynamic layout** — support for 2 or more columns using `---` separator
- 🖼️ **Auto-scaling images** inside blocks
- 💾 **Block width persistence** — remembers layout when you return

> [!WARNING]
> Please refrain from entering **tasks** directly within the Horizontal code block. 
>
> The Horizontal function operates based on the code block. In Obsidian, text within a code block is treated as plain text. Consequently, if you input tasks inside a code block, neither the tasks plugin nor the dataview plugin will be able to recognize them.

## 👏🏼 Support

Have you found the **Horizontal Blocks** plugin helpful, and want to support it? I welcome donations to support future development efforts. However, I typically do not accept payments for bug bounties or feature requests, as financial incentives can create stress and expectations that I prefer to avoid in my hobby project!
