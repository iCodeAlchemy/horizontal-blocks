## 👏🏼 Support

Have you found the **Horizontal Blocks** plugin helpful, and want to support it? I welcome donations to support future development efforts. However, I typically do not accept payments for bug bounties or feature requests, as financial incentives can create stress and expectations that I prefer to avoid in my hobby project!
